# SQL-query-generator
This project aims to simplify database interaction by allowing users to express their queries in natural English language, which are then converted into SQL queries and executed against a backend database. Using NLP techniques and a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), the system dynamically generates SQL queries tailored to the user's intent.
# Features:
**Natural Language Understanding:** Users can input commands in plain English, making database querying more intuitive.<br/>
**Dynamic SQL Generation:** The system generates SQL queries based on interpreted commands, covering various SQL operations.<br/>
**Error Handling:** Provides informative responses for ambiguous or erroneous commands to guide users towards accurate queries.<br/>
**Database Interaction:** Seamlessly connects to a backend database to execute generated SQL queries and retrieve results.<br/>
**Customization:** Offers flexibility for users to customize or extend functionality to suit specific database schemas or requirements.<br/>
# Usage:
Install dependencies: **pip install -r requirements.txt**<br/>
Run the application: **python app.py**<br/>
Input English commands describing your database query.<br/>
Receive the corresponding SQL query and its output from the database.<br/>
