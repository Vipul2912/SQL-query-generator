# SQL-query-generator
This project aims to simplify database interaction by allowing users to express their queries in natural English language, which are then converted into SQL queries and executed against a backend database. Using NLP techniques and a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), the system dynamically generates SQL queries tailored to the user's intent.
